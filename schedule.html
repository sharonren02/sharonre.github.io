				<h1> Fall 2021 Courses</h1>
				<p> As a second-year business student, I have completed most of the prerequisites needed to take higher level business courses. Currently, I am taking 
					two business classes (Organizational Behavior and Business Communications). I am also taking two math courses (Multivariate Analysis and Concepts of Mathematics), as well as
					Mobile Web Design & Development. </p>

				<p>Outside of class schedule, I currently tutor for elementary and middle school kids in Math and English, while also working at the Computing Help Desk. I'm also looking forward 
					to participating in an HCI project to further my experience in UX design, as that was something that I really enjoyed throughout the summer.
